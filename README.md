# About ほたるび #
This is ほたるび (Hotarubi), a hobby OS developed from scratch just for the sake
of it. The development started in August 2014 and is ongoing.

Depending on how things work out there may one day be more sources like 
userspace or even ports of existing software here. But for now it's just the
sources required to build the kernel itself.

Unless otherwise stated all files are licensed under the GNU GPL (see COPYING)
for details. Most files contain proper licensing headers at the top stating the
license a few (mostly in-development code) may not. Regardless they are covered
by the GNU GPL license.
